1. We can improve the search, I have implemented a naive approach
Which fetched the keywords from query and searches it in DB.
Indexing is added on Content column of Post table.

There is full-text search.
We can keep the content of post in a No-SQL DB. SQL Db is not good for full text searches.

We keep postId and content in NoSQL DB.
And add index on content
When we search , inverted index is created.
